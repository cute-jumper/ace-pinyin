Jump to Chinese characters using =ace-jump-mode= or =avy=.

* Setup
  Install via [[http://melpa.org/#/ace-pinyin][melpa]].

  Or if you prefer install this package manually:
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ace-pinyin.el")
  : (require 'ace-pinyin)

* Usage
  By default this package is using =avy=. If you want to use =ace-jump-mode=,
  set =ace-pinyin-use-avy= to =nil=.

  Note =ace-pinyin-use-avy= variable should be set *BEFORE* you call
  =ace-pinyin-global-mode= or =turn-on-ace-pinyin-mode=.

  Example config to use =ace-pinyin= globally:
  : ;; (setq ace-pinyin-use-avy nil) ;; uncomment if you want to use `ace-jump-mode'
  : (ace-pinyin-global-mode +1)

* Supported Commands
  When using =avy=, the following commands are supported:
  - =avy-goto-char=
  - =avy-goto-char-2=
  - =avy-goto-char-in-line=
  - =avy-goto-word-0=
  - =avy-goto-word-1=
  - =avy-goto-subword-0=
  - =avy-goto-subword-1=
  - =avy-goto-word-or-subword-1=

  When using =ace-jump-mode=, the following command is supported:
  - =ace-jump-char-mode=

  More commands will be added gradually and PRs are always welcome!

  When the =ace-pinyin-mode= is enabled, the supported commands will be able to
  jump to both Chinese and English characters/words. That is, you don't need
  remember extra commands or create extra key bindings in order to jump to
  Chinese characters. All you need to do is to enable the minor mode and use
  your =avy= or =ace-jump-mode= key bindings to jump to Chinese characters.

  In addition, you can also use English punctuations to jump to Chinese/English
  punctuations. For example, use =.= to jump to both =。= and =.=, and =<= to
  jump to both =《= and =<= etc. Behind the scene, =ace-pinyin= uses
  [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/pinyinlib.el][pinyinlib.el]] to translate the letter to Simplified/Traditional Chinese
  characters and English punctuations to Chinese punctuations. To see the full
  list of punctuactions that are supported, see [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/pinyinlib.el][pinyinlib.el]].

  Besides, all other packages using =ace-jump-mode= (or =avy=) will also be able
  to handle Chinese characters. For example, if you've installed [[https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap][ace-jump-zap]],
  it will also be able to zap to a Chinese character by the first letter of
  pinyin. Note =ace-jump-zap= is implemented by using =ace-jump-mode=, so you
  can't use =avy= in this case. You can check out my fork of =ace-jump-zap=
  using =avy=: [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/avy-zap][avy-zap]].

* Traditional Chinese Characters Support
  By default, =ace-pinyin= only supports simplified Chinese characters. You can
  make =ace-pinyin= aware of traditional Chinese characters by the following
  setting:
  : (setq ace-pinyin-simplified-chinese-only-p nil)

* Disable Word Jumping Support
  By default, =ace-pinyin= will remap both word jumping and character jumping
  methods in =avy=. If you only want to remap character jumping methods, use:
  : (setq ace-pinyin-treat-word-as-char nil)

  After setting this, the following commands in =avy= are not able to jump to
  Chinese characters:
  - =avy-goto-word-0=
  - =avy-goto-word-1=
  - =avy-goto-subword-0=
  - =avy-goto-subword-1=
  - =avy-goto-word-or-subword-1=

* Disable Punctuactions Translation
  If you don't like the punctuaction support(/i.e./, using English punctuations
  to jump to both Chinese/English punctuations), use the following code to
  disable it:
  : (setq ace-pinyin-enable-punctuation-translation nil)

* Other available commands
  These commands are not provided in either =avy= or =ace-jump-mode=. They're
  provided in this package in case someone finds them useful. You need to assign
  key bindings for the commands if you want to use them.
** =ace-pinyin-dwim=
   If called with no prefix, it can jump to both Chinese characters and English
   letters. If called with prefix, it can only jump to Chinese characters.

** =ace-pinyin-jump-word=
   Using this command, you can jump to the start of a sequence of Chinese
   characters(/i.e./ Chinese word) by typing the sequence of the first letters
   of these character's pinyins. If called without prefix, this command will
   read user's input with a default timeout 1 second(You can customize the
   timeout value). If called with prefix, then it will read input from the
   minibuffer and starts search after you press
   @@html:<kbd>@@enter@@html:</kbd>@@.

* Demos
  *WARNING*: The following demos are a little bit outdated.

  Enable =ace-pinyin-mode= and use =ace-jump-char-mode= to jump to Chinese
  characters:
  [[./screencasts/ace-pinyin-jump-char.gif]]

  If you have installed [[https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap][ace-jump-zap]], then enabling =ace-pinyin-mode= will also
  make =ace-jump-zap-to-char= capable of handling Chinese characters.

* Change Log

  UPDATE(2015-11-26): Now jumping to traditional Chinese characters is supported
  by setting =ace-pinyin-simplified-chinese-only-p= to =nil=.

  UPDATE(2016-05-01): Now =ace-pinyin= uses =avy= by default. If you want to use
  =ace-jump-mode=, use:
  : (setq ace-pinyin-use-avy nil)

  UPDATE(2016-05-02): A new variable =ace-pinyin-treat-word-as-char= is added and
  its default value is =t=. When this variable is =t=, =ace-pinyin= remaps both
  word and character jumping commands in =avy= or =ace-jump-mode=. For example, if
  you're using =avy=, setting this variable to =t= will make =avy-goto-word-*= and
  =avy-goto-subword-*= be able to jump to Chinese characters as well as English
  words.

  UPDATE(2015-05-05): Add =ace-pinyin-enable-punctuation-translation=.

  UPDATE(2015-05-05): Now =ace-pinyin= depends on [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/pinyinlib.el][pinyinlib.el]].
